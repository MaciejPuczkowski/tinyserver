Tinyserver is meant to be tiny. It has only one purpose. To serve compiled web application as the static files.
It assumes that all of the routing, safety, load balancing and so on will be provided earlier. In the other words
you will need another server standing in front of this one.

Tinyserver is bluntly simple.
